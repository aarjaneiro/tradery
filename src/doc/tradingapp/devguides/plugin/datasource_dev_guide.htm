<h1>Data Source Developer’s Guide</h1>

<hr color="#C4DDD7">

<p>A SimLib compatible data source must implement the
DataSource abstract class defined in &quot;datasource.h&quot;. </p>

<p>This release comes with 2 datasource plug-ins: a&nbsp; file based static datasource (file_ds) and a simulated
real-time data source. A Quotes Plus data source is currently being adapted for
the new plug-in protocol. They all come with complete source code.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>DataSource API</h3>

<p>The DateSource API contains all the
interfaces that a SimLib data source plugin needs to implement. It also
contains the definitions for some basic types such as DataUnit (the basic
element of data such as bar or tick), DataCollection (a collection of data
units), and some specialized forms of these, such as Bars (bar collection) and
Ticks (tick collection).</p>

<p>Data sources adapters constitute the link
between a physical data source such as a database, file system, an online data
provider etc. and the TradingApp framework. In addition to delivering the data
requested by the framework, they are also supposed to perform consistency
checks on this data, which is required for the proper and efficient functioning
of the framework's internal caches. The datasource adapter is free to perform
its own caching or other internal optimizations in order to speed up the
retrieval and delivery of data.</p>

<h3>Multithreading</h3>

<p>A data source plug-in maintains one of a DataSource
derived class which will receive data requests coming from multiple threads and
synchronization objects such as Mutex and Lock (defined in simlib.h) will have
to be used.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please consult the source code for the projects
fileplugins and dyndsplugin and for more details.</p>
