it is a functional plug-in used for retrieving data stored in files, and it is also a
programming sample illustrating various techniques for how to write a plug-in in
general and a data source plug-in in particular.</p>

<p>The FD is described it from a functional and user
interface standpoint. For more details on the programming aspects, please refer
to various Dev Guides.</p>

<p>The  FD is normally
listed in the Plug-in Explorer under DataSource Plug-ins/File Data Source. A FD
configuration will retrieve the the data for a set of symbols. </p>

<p>The FD makes certain assumptions about the data

  <li>all files are located in the same directory </li>
  <li>all files have the same extension</li>
  <li>all files have the same format</li>
