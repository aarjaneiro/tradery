<h2>Plug-in Configurations</h2>
<p>A plug-in, to be useful, must be able to provide at least one configuration, 
although many plug-ins will be capable of handling the creation of more than one 
configuration.</p>
<p>For example, a typical plug-in is the pre-packaged file based data source 
plug-in which can access data stored on files, in various formats. Various 
configurations of this plug-in could point to different data location and/or to 
recognize different data formats. Similarly, configurations of the file based 
symbols source plug-in can each point to&nbsp;different symbols files, containing 
different sets of symbols.</p>
<p>All plug-ins and plug-in configurations have 3 main properties:</p>
<ul>
  <li>unique id.</li>
  <li>name</li>
  <li>description</li>
</ul>
<p>The first is used by the platform to uniquely identify each component, while 
the last two serve only a descriptive purpose to allow users to easily identify 
components and their functionality.</p>
<p>Besides their primary purpose of providing specific trading related 
functional services, all plug-in configurations can also provide their own UI, 
either for visual feedback and/or to enable user control of their parameters and 
functionality. There are no limitations in terms of what a plug-in configuration 
can show in its UI. Also, the plug-in protocol ensures a seamless integration 
between any plug-in configuration UI and all the other visual elements of the 
IVTE.</p>
