<title>The File Signal Handler Plugin has a dual functional role</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>The File Signal Handler Plugin has a dual functional role:</p>

<ol>
  <li>it is a signal handler plug-in that keeps track of generated trading 
  signals and can save them to files</li>
  <li>calculates and displays statistical information for the current session. 
  </li>
</ol>

<p>It can be used as such or as a programming sample illustrating various 
techniques for how to write plug-ins, how to write a signal handler plug-in and how to create a 
plug-in with its own UI.</p>

<p>The information necessary for statistical calculations is received by means 
of various session notifications that are sent to all plug-ins.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: this plug-in started out as a simple trading signal tracking 
plug-in, but has evolved into the much more complex component that it is 
currently. As a consequence, the statistical functionality will be removed and 
implemented as a stand-alone plug-in in a future release.</p>

<p>Here we'll describe the File Signal Handler Plugin from a functional and user
interface standpoint. For more details on the programming aspects, please refer
to various Dev Guides.</p>

<h3>Configuring the File Signal Handler</h3>

<p>The File Signal Handler Plug-in (FSHP ) is  listed in the Plug-in Explorer under Signal Handler Plug-ins/File Signal
Handler. A FSHP configuration will save trading signals generated during a
session run to a file on disk.</p>

<p>The FSHP supports all plug-in operations: creation,
editing and removing of configurations. To create a new FSHP configuration right
click over the plug-in name and select Create. This will bring up the following dialog box:</p>
