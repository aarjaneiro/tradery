<ul>
  <li>Name - can be any string; it will be listed in
    the plug-in tree.</li>
  <li>Description - optional string that is used to
    describe the configuration</li>
  <li>Id - a system generated predefined unique id identifying the
    configuration, read only</li>
  <li>Enable saving signals - enables saving
    signals in real time if checked</li>

</ul>
<p>This dialog only configures parameters related to the trading signal handling 
functionality. No configuration is needed for the statistics functionality of 
the FSHP - when the session is complete, statistics will automatically be 
calculated and displayed.</p>
<p>Multiple configurations of the FSHP can be created, each for a
different path, base file name, extension.</p>
<p>Once created, a configuration's parameters are
stored in the registry and the configuration will be available every time the TradingApp is run.
A configuration can also be edited - all parameters except for its Id can be
changed. If a configuration is no longer needed, it can be removed, which will
delete it from the registry as well.</p>
<h3>The File Signal Handler UI</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, the FSHP has its own
UI by supporting the simple UI protocol of the plug-in configuration API. When
added to or loaded into a session, a plug-in configuration will add a new tab to
the already existing tabs in the session window. Here is the portion showing the
file signal handler window:</p>
